# Responsive Web Design Projects

This repository contains a collection of responsive web design projects I completed as part of the [Responsive Web Design Certification](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/) by freeCodeCamp.

Each project was built using **HTML** and **CSS**, with a focus on responsive layouts and semantic structure.
